\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The motivation of this project comes from the registration of 3D faces. Using Discrete Ricci Flow and conformal mapping, we can map a 3D face onto a 2D image. Registration work is done on this 2D image. Our project focuses on the second step. We use MRF energy to represent the matching problem and minimize the energy to achieve our goal. This work has been specified in \cite{shekhovtsov2008efficient}.

\section{Introduction}

Face registration is always widely used in many areas. In medical field, cosmetology demands accurate registration between face models of the same person to see the change as time. And this market worths billions of dollars in United States. \\
According Prof. Xianfeng David Gu's previous work, a face 3D model could be mapped onto a 2D image using conformal mapping. Based on this work, we focus on the image registration using Markov Random Field(MRF). We define a MRF energy function and try to minimize it to get the deformation, which transforms an image to another. As for the optimisation method, we use both Iterative Conditional Modes(ICM) and TRW-S, and compare the results of them. \\
We will introduce the algorithm in Section 2, and present the result in Section 3. Future work will be found in Section 4.

\subsection{Define Energy Functioin}
Since we use MRF to register two images, we need to define the MRF energy function.
